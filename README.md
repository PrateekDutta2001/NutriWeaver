# Motivation

People from all around the world are getting more concerned in their health and way of life in today's modern environment. However, avoiding junk food and exercising alone are insufficient; we also need to eat a balanced diet. We can live a healthy life with a balanced diet based on our height, weight, and age. Your diet can help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight, lower your chance of developing chronic diseases (including cancer and heart disease), and improve your general health when combined with physical activity. Nevertheless, there is a little SOTA project on food/diet recommendation system. Therefore I got the idea to build a content-based recommendation system for this purpose using machine learning.
